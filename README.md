Disaster Community Hub is an app designed to connect individuals affected by disasters with those who are ready to help. Victims can quickly call for assistance, 
while volunteers can find opportunities to provide support. By streamlining communication in times of crisis, the app fosters a collaborative community to ensure
help reaches those who need it most.
